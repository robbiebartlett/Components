										<h2>Maia Rauhina – LSV Graduate from Whanganui</h2>
										<p class="summary">This is the transcript of the video Maia Rauhina – LSV Graduate from Whanganui</p>
										<p>A Fresh Start</p>
										<p>Name graphic: Maia, 2019 LSV graduate</p>
										<p>V/O transcript</p>
										<p>“I would say to those who are struggling to get a job, to find direction in life, to join LSV</p>
										<p>At the start it was challenging and a struggle, didn’t understand why we did what we did.</p>
										<p>But then as I started to build with everyone; you start to build a family; you start to build a connection.</p>
										<p>One of the best things I got out of LSV was, probably for the long run, a job. Throughout LSV they hold a work expedition which a lot of employers come around from NZ.</p>
										<p>Having a job will mean a lot for me. It’ll help me grow independently. I’ll be earning my own money which will feel more rewarding and deserving.</p>
										<p>And you grow so much. You don’t see it but the people around you see it and then your families will see it when you get back.</p>
										<p>And at the end you feel so proud to be who you are.”</p>
